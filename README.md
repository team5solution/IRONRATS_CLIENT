# IRONRATS_CLIENT
The client side in the project IRON RATS
This is a group project in the course CST8258 WEb Project Management. It is developed with Reactjs, Redux, JSON Web Token, Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB. 
If projects are pulled to local, run "node server" or "npm start" command on IRON Server to start the service on server side(For development and debug, run "npm run server"). The server will listen port 3000 and connect MongoDB. For IRON Client, you need to execute "yarn" command to install all dependencies (if you don't have yarn on your laptop, please install it at first), and then run "npm start" to start the client program. The client program will listen port 8000.
